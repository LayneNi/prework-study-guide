## Description

This website is an all in one study guide for students in coding bootcamp. This application lists the essential topics a student will learn in bootcamp each accompanied with notes describing the topic. I built this project to help coding bootcamp students because I myself am a bootcamp student.I know first-hand how difficult it can be to keep track of all of the information learned in bootamp, so I designed a site to contain all of the information learned throughout the three month process. I learned a lot about the coding process from start to finish when developing this application. Following guides and learning from my mistakes has already taught me so much. This webpage will revolutionize studying for bootcamp students!
